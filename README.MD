# XanBotCore
A core system for Discord bots running on DSharpPlus Nightly v4.0.0-00635, built in .NET Framework 4.7.2

# Example
There is an EXAMPLE_BOT folder present in the repository with a bare-bones Discord bot that runs in my core. It features a basic implementation of `BotContext`, `Command`, and `PassiveHandler` (the three primary classes used for bot control)
